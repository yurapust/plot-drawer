Simple multithread plot drawer

The purpose of this repository is to show my coding style.

Features:
  - Data load using QFuture;
  - Drawing functionality is realized in a separate thread;

Functionality of drawing has several drawbacks:
  - The timestamp doesn`t count;
  - Lack of axes signature;
  - Method of drawing is poor (first though up solution).

Drawbacks are planed to resolve.
